        <p>A preparation of bread dough folded into a filled pizza, the calzone is characteristic of various southern Italian cuisines.</p>
        <p>The dough is folded into a half circle or tube, either baked or fried.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dry milk powder</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
                <li>¾ cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>4 ounces pepperoni sausage, chopped</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
           
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place water, salt, bread flour, dry milk, sugar, and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle.</li>
                <li>When the cycle has finished, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet</li>
                <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface; shape it into a 16x10-inch rectangle. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix together chopped pepperoni and mozzarella. Spoon pizza sauce in a stripe down the center of dough lengthwise; add pepperoni and cheese filling. Make diagonal cuts 1 1/2 inches apart down each side, cutting within a 1/2 inch of the filling. Criss-cross strips over filling, sealing with water. Brush top with melted butter.</li>
                <li>Bake calzone in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
