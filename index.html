        <a href="./recipes/spaghetti.html">Spaghetti all'Assassina</a>

            <p>There's something a little bit suspicious about the origin story of this "to die for" pasta's name. Sure, a customer jokingly asking the chef if they're trying to "kill them" with this intensely flavored Spaghetti all'Assassina is sort of believable, but I've always felt like there was much more to the story. Hey, can we get a few of these true crime podcasters on the case?</p>
            <p>Anyway, regardless of the real story (possibly involving the Medicis, and probably also the Opus Dei), this spicy, partially pan-fried spaghetti dish is as unusual as it is addictively delicious. As the head assassin, you get to decided exactly how spicy and charred this gets, but as I said in the video, the sweetness and acidity of the caramelized tomato sauce balances the heat from the chili flakes, so don't worry about using a heavy hand.</p>
